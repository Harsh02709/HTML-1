<h3>Try out some of my favorite foods </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Pani Puri (#1st) </li>
  <li> nothing can beat pani puri (according to me) but you may try these as well </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Chinese </li> 
    <li> Dosa with green mint sauce </li> 
    <li>Thereâ€™s a lot more, but leaving junk food aside, you can try the foods we eat normally. They are the best and also healthy.</li>
  </ol>
  
  </ul>

<h3> I hope you have a great trip. Thank you!</h3>
